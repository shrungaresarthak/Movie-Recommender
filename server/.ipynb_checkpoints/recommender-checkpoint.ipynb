       "([\"There's something that seems deeply contradictory to the very nature of Kaurismaki's stuff - cinema which at the same time invites the viewer to pay closer attention while shunning him with his trademark apathy and deadpan humour. His characters appear hard, untearful and unselfpitying, their sentiments hermetically sealed behind glacial walls of Finnish unfeeling, yet behind the expressionless mask burn desire and pathos, the truly human stuff. It is not about negation, though it may seem so at first.Everything Kaurismaki worked towards in his career up to Ariel is brought to a glorious, brilliant blooming here. Composition, shot selection, framing and lighting, everything clicks together to form a cinematic language that threatens to burst at the seams with meaningful restraint. Restraint in which silence communicates. His mastering of the craft so much perfected that dialogue becomes largely irrelevant. There are few lines and they appear to be utilized as a stylistic manner, short and delivered with deadpan unaffection, more than exposition.Indeed Ariel is a movie mostly told in a visual manner, built upon scene by scene, in a steady and hypnotic succession not concerned with reaching emotionally draining highs and lows as much as with building an unbreakable rhythm of its own. And so it does, to the point that a 69 minute movie appears to last much longer, without outstaying its welcome.\",\n",
       "  'When I first saw Ariel, at the beginning of the Nineties, maybe three years after it was first released, it blew me away. At the time I had gone through a long streak of awful \"alternative\" movies, the last one having been Atom Egoyan\\'s \"The Adjuster\"; I was totally depressed and fed up with cinema in general since all the movies around seemed to be either generic Hollywood block busters or equally generic \"intellectual\" time wasters -- \"The Adjuster\" being a perfect example of the latter category. When I left the cinema after having seen Ariel, I had tears of joy in my eyes, thinking: \"thank god, I do not have to give up going to the cinema after all\". Ariel is exactly the movie I wish I had made, very cool, funny, stylish, engaging, romantic, hard core, subtle. I have seen it many times since, it has become my all - time favourite, desert - island movie. Of course there are other good movies around, but few which match its quality, and none of them changed my outlook on cinema the way Ariel did. Other KaurismÃ¤kis movies I have seen and loved are \"MacBeth\", \"I Hired A Contract Killer\", \"La vie de bohÃ¨me\", \"Tulitikkutehtaan tyttÃ¶\" (\"The Match Factory Girl\"), \"Juha\"; the Leningrad Cowboy flicks were OK, but not really my cup of tea.Anyway, I have a small anecdote I want to get off my chest: shortly after seeing A I was talking with a couple of co - workers about movies, and one of them said: \"the other day I saw the best movie ever, it\\'s called Ariel, it blew me away, I haven\\'t washed my eyes since\", etc. I thought, wow, I would have never thought that she would like that movie, but there you go, truly good movies just have a universal appeal. Only years later did I find out that she had been talking about not KaurismÃ¤kis\\' masterpiece but Disney\\'s \"Arielle -- The Little Mermaid\". ;-)',\n",
       "  'In the two opening sequences of Ariel (1988) - director Aki KaurismÃ¤ki\\'s typically straight-faced character study about a life and its cruel ironies - the main character, Taisto, watches as the mine where he once worked is closed and demolished, only to then observe with a calm detachment the suicide of his father in a coffee shop restroom. Both sequences are captured in KaurismÃ¤ki\\'s typically deadpan approach that is rife with a cruel satire and an almost absurd sense of humour, whilst also setting up the spirit of defeat, failure and the unpredictable twists of fate that will conspire against the character throughout the rest of the film. From here we follow Taisto as he travels from Lapland to Helsinki in a Cadillac with no roof, and observe his completely disconnected and often bemused approach to life as he wanders the city, falls in love, goes to prison and ultimately, learns something about himself along the way.For me, the film was somewhat reminiscent of Lindsay Anderson\\'s O Lucky Man! (1973), with KaurismÃ¤ki presenting the film as an incongruous, picaresque fable that is rich in character, humour and an astute sense of pathos. Like Anderson\\'s film, the plot is relatively simple in a cinematic sense - with the emphasis on a single character charting an unconventional path through life - but is adapted on a completely epic scale, with the sheer number of adventures and misadventures packed into such a tight running time destroying any broader notion of the \"social realist\" tag that many have applied to KaurismÃ¤ki\\'s earlier works. Although I love his first three films, in particular Crime and Punishment (1983) and The Calimari Union (1985), for me, KaurismÃ¤ki really started to settle into his trademark style with Ariel, building on the greatness of the previous year\\'s Hamlet Goes Business (1987) and setting the scene for later films such as Take Care of Your Scarf, Tatiana (1994), Juha (1999) and The Man Without a Past (2002).Like many of KaurismÃ¤ki\\'s best works, the reason Ariel works so well is as a result of the perfect casting. Every single performance in this film is great in its own unique little way, and really manages to convey a great deal about the characters and their roles within the film, without having to fall back on lengthy scenes of dialog and exposition. The structure and visualisation of the film is light as a feather, as KaurismÃ¤ki takes one shot of a character looking pensively from a window and carefully examining a half-empty packet of cigarettes and gives us a wealth of information, not only about where these characters are coming from, but also where they\\'re heading. As with the other two films in the trilogy, and indeed, many of the director\\'s other works, the film skilfully manages to walk that fine line between a cruel and mocking sense of humour- as we watch these characters strive and fail and ultimately fall flat on their faces in such a manner as to offer an obvious comedic punch - and a genuine sense of warmth and compassion.If you\\'re at all familiar with KaurismÃ¤ki\\'s particular style of directing from films like Shadows in Paradise (1986) and The Match Factory Girl (1990), then you\\'ll already have some idea of what to expect from the film in question; with those particular films acting as the bookends (with Ariel in between) to an informal trilogy of works looking at the downtrodden underclass constantly striving for hope and happiness in a cold and confusing world. Out of the three films in this loose triptych of modern-day fables, Ariel is for me the most moving and entertaining, and is also the one in which KaurismÃ¤ki themes and motifs are best served by the character and the situations he finds himself in. The direction is truly great; typical of KaurismÃ¤ki\\'s minimal approach, with self-consciously flat and iconic compositions and an incredibly warm approach to lighting, while the script and the characters are strong enough to draw us in and make the experience all the more rewarding.',\n",
       "  'Further stabilizing his position among my favorite filmmakers, Aki KaurismÃ¤ki has crafted yet another masterpiece with \"Ariel\", a hilarious and heartbreaking love story that chronicles a life both destroyed and saved by crime. Like he beautifully accomplishes in most of his films, KaurismÃ¤ki mixes dry humor and brooding melancholy in a realistic, natural manner. The atmosphere is layered with realism, but also playfulness. The story is layered with sadness, but also comedy. KaurismÃ¤ki masterfully translates all of the comedies and tragedies of life to the screen, populating this interpretation of the human experience with unconventional heroes and some of international cinema\\'s most unexpectedly kind hearted characters. KaurismÃ¤ki humanizes those who would often be looked upon as despicable criminals in a way that makes me root for them more than I would for any superhero. This is not your conventional, mainstream Hollywood film, but it still remains entertaining and accessible. It is a quiet character study that blossoms into a love story, a black comedy, and a bleak crime drama all at once.',\n",
       "  \"This 1988 feature from Finland's answer to Jim Jarmusch is a deadpan shaggy dog comedy charting the downfall and redemption of an unemployed mine worker, over several tentative episodes constructed not unlike a series of false starts. It begins, initially, as something like a road film; begins again as a romance; then begins yet again as an underworld crime drama, before finally ending in what could be just another prologue (which would make the entire film one large, elaborate tease). Kaurismaki's wayward hero is, like the scenario itself, pleasantly reticent; there's something undeniably disarming about the way he simply drifts from one predicament to another, even if the total effect makes each scene difficult to recall in detail afterward. It may not amount to much, but after a summer full of over-hyped, mega-budget, wannabe blockbusters Kaurismaki's economical humor is hard to resist.\",\n",
       "  'A new trend has emerged in world cinema which consists of portraying marginal characters from small towns who are unable to make better lives for themselves.It has been appreciated both by critics as well as ordinary film lovers as they are fed up of imaginary tales about urban centers which are nothing but an eyewash.Many filmmakers from Europe have explored this trend in their films in order to give audiences worldwide a realistic dose of humanity coupled with realism.Ariel is one such film directed by maverick Finnish director Aki Kaurismaki whose films have always made a point to portray harsh socio economic realities of Finland.Ariel is a film with universal sense of purpose as by depicting human mobility,a challenging film about a primitive human instinct has been filmed.Aki Kaurismaki shows us how his protagonist Taisto Kasurinen battles all odds to gain love,respect and trust in his difficult life full of unexpected challenges.A curious element that must be noted by an astute viewer about Ariel is that it is not at all a thriller film although rapid succession of events might suggest such a plausibility.There is a place for every possible genre in Ariel.We see comedy,drama and thriller all at the same time interspersed with natural beauty of icy Finnish landscape which has been popularized due to films by Aki Kaurismaki and his equally charismatic filmmaker brother Mika Kaurismaki.',\n",
       "  'Possibly Aki Kaurismaki\\'s most action-filled spectacle! Within the first five minutes of this film, an explosion happens, a gun goes off, and a man is mugged--all more action than all of the other Aki Kaurismaki movies I\\'ve seen put together. That said, I am coming from the perspective of a person who has seen other Kaurismaki films--people coming into this from other perspectives would react more to the deadpan and flat nature of it, unless they were familiar with Wes Anderson and Jim Jarmusch, two people obviously inspired by this type of movie.Ariel is quite honest, hilarious, and hopeful all at the same time, despite it\\'s aloof and deadpan nature. At the moment when the woman asks the man, \"My husband left us, will you leave?\" and he says, not missing a beat to think, \"I\\'ll be with you forever\", neither without blinking or emoting, you nevertheless know that they are not lying and fully mean everything they say. A movie about bad luck, not bad people, Ariel somehow mixes hopes and dreams with squalor and poverty without once falling into maudlin sentimentality. It\\'s almost uncanny, if for the fact that it is in no way unfamiliar.I can see why this one is the movie that got Kaurismaki his international recognition. It meets the viewer half way, providing something fun to look at with meaningful, witty storytelling while providing a nice alternative to the schmaltz of most Hollywood movies and the dramatics international audiences seek in the art house circuit.--PolarisDiB',\n",
       "  \"This is the second Aki KaurismÃ¤ki film I have seen.The first one was 'The Man Without a Past. After enjoying that a lot, I decided to watch the other movies of Kaurismaki, because I believe he is very good in expressing the 'life' through the simple daily life events or talks. When I watched Ariel, the first thing I noticed was, as in the previous movie, the characters don't speak much, but when they speak they are concise and to the point. The relationships start very abruptly and different from what is normally expected, but all of them end up being loyal and caring. With the beginning of the journey of the miner (Kasurinen) to the south by a convertible car, the movie also starts to present its comedy, romance, action and drama. Kasurinen keeps his calmness through all that happens to him and in the end he achieves his goal. I can recommend this movie to those who like details .\",\n",
       "  '\"Ariel\" is the story of a Finnish minor who has just lost his job. In the canteen, his father tells him that he, too, is fed up with this industry, all you can - says he - is boozing your brains away, but this is of no use. However, there is another way, the father continues, takes out his gun, says, but it is not a solution either, yet, I will do it anyway, takes the gun with him in the restroom. One hears a shot, then the collapse of a body. The son still drinks beer, it takes him a while to realize what happens. He stands up, goes to a bank, withdraws all his money, takes fathers car out of a garage and drives to Hamburger place. There, two men see the money in his pocket, knock him down, steal the money. When he awakes, he drives to a shipyard, engages as a laborer, sleeps in the night in a Christian charity place. The next day, he gets a ticket, tells the woman that she is no good cop but attractive, she answers he is right, but she is divorced and has a child, he responds, that\\'s good, then we do not have anymore to build up a family.Aki KaurismÃ¤ki, \"the Finnish Fassbinder\" (although he does not need this comparison), is a master of minimalism. Not only are the dialogs absolutely minimal, but one really wonders who his movies are understandable through the fragments of reality he gives and from which the audience must build up his recognition of what the movie wants to communicate. Then the music. I am really convinced that nobody else than Fassbinder and KaurismÃ¤ki have the talent to bring the exactly fitting movie to the exactly right situation in the precisely correct moment. KaurismÃ¤ki\\'s movies \"blow you away\", because in their minimal-\"invasive\" metaphysics, they can be cathartic.'],\n",

       " (['This is a movie that surpasses the original one on many different levels! It has a better villain, a better story and, most of all, a better message. The movie is about Peter Parker who loses faith in what he does, so he loses his powers. Tobey Maguire is magnificent in this movie and he plays so well off of all the other actors in the movie. Alfred Molina is great as the villain and, as always, J.K. Simmons steal every single scene in which he is present. This is really one of the best superhero movies that has ever been made.',\n",
       "   \"The first and third 'Spider-Man' movies were simply fantastic.But it gets even better with 'Spider-Man 2'. It's full of action, has plenty of adventure, and is full of award winning special effects.Like any other super hero sequel, there's always a new villain.The villains name in 'Spider-Man 2' is Dr. Octopus.AKA Doc Ock.He has 4 mechanical tentacles that can flip cars and throw people at great distances.Does he remind you of anything? Of course he does.What does he remind you of? An Octopus... Duh.It may sound kind of stupid, but Doc Ock's character actually helps the movie become a 2 hour roller-coaster ride of a movie.Just remember that Spider-Man can do whatever a spider can.\",\n",
       "   'Spiderman 2 is the best Spiderman movie. To me it feels more like a movie about Peter\\'s struggles of being Spiderman. This was the movie which cemented my love for the character.The cast is great again. Especially Peter and Harry, which are both much better. However MJ is more of the same being a damsel in distress.Throughout the movie Peter sees the consequences of being Spiderman. His life is literally falling apart. Everyone is moving on and he\\'s stuck because he has to be Spiderman. He loses his job, he\\'s failing his classes in University, MJ is getting married, Aunt May is moving out, he\\'s struggling to pay rent, while J. Jonah Jameson (J. K. Simmons) is dragging SpiderMan\\'s name in the mud. Everything is going wrong for Peter and you can\\'t help but feel bad for him. He\\'s such a nice guy, and he\\'s going above and beyond to help others, but no one is helping back. This is the first CBM to truly show the struggles of being a Hero. This movie shows Peter at his lowest.In this movie we see him tell Aunt May he \"caused\" Uncle Ben\\'s death, and Aunt May kicks him out. Just WOW, his life just went downhill.Sometimes the movie is a bit goofy the way it shows his misfortune, but it works because it\\'s played out in a surprisingly hilarious way. It uses comedy to lighten up the movie. He even starts to lose his powers.Later in the story we get introduced to Dr. Otto Octavious (Alfred Molina) who was great. He\\'s creating a sustainable fusion power reactor, and he made 4 bionic arms which are impervious to heat and magnetism and are needed for the reactor. He teams up with Oscorp for funding, and With the help of Harry, Peter is able to write his paper on Otto. Peter and Otto hit it off with both being \"brilliant\" and we meet his wife. He explains why he is doing this with a great line very similar to \"With great power comes great responsibility\" line. \"Intelligence is not a privilege, it\\'s a gift, to be used for the good of mankind.\" This instantly shows the parallels between Peter and Otto and shows his motivations. When Otto finally tests out the reactor it unfortunately becomes unstable. Instead of stopping the reactor, Otto believes it will work. However the reactor kills his wife and damages the neural inhibitor chip in his spine, which doesn\\'t let the AI from the arms influence his own brain. He\\'s brought to a hospital while he\\'s knocked out, in a great scene which shows Sam Raimi\\'s horror roots. The arms take over and start brutally murdering the doctors. Oscorp is left bankrupt. Now we have the birth of our villain.After everything going wrong Peter decided to give up being Spider-man. I think this is great. It shows peter is a human and sometimes you just want to give up. So he does, and his life does get back on track. He\\'s getting better grades, he can finally make it to MJ\\'s play, he can possibly pay rent. He\\'s starting to ignore crime, but soon realizes he can\\'t stop. This is where the hero is tested and needs to come back. Crime is up 70%. Very similarly to the first movie there\\'s a fire where Peter decides to be the hero himself, and he saves the baby, but just when he was about to be praised for his bravery he\\'s told that someone was stuck and died. Once again peter realizes that Spiderman is needed. With great power comes great responsibility, so Spiderman comes back!Theres the bank robbery with the bags full of gold coins, which is very comic book like, and we have the iconic train battle. Peter gives it his all to stop the train and saves everyone, but he doesn\\'t have his mask, and everyone sees him as a hero, and understand that they need him, so none of them say anything about his identity. This is hero praise done right. They respect the hero, despite revealing his identity probably getting the person famous or rich, they respect Spiderman for the sacrifice. And then when everyone tries to protect Spiderman it shows how everyone is trying to give back to Spiderman.After this Spiderman is given to Harry where we get a great scene where Harry finds out Peter is Spiderman to further fuel their rivalry.The third act is somewhat weak for me. MJ is of course the damsel in distress again, the reactor is a bit too unrealistic, but I do think\\noverall it was a pretty good fight with large stakes. Doc Ock sacrifices himself to finally stop the machine and MJ now knows who Spiderman. Peter finally gets his happy ending.This is one of the rare sequels where everything has been improved. I think Spiderman 2 is one of the best CBMs. It really shows the struggles and consequences of being a hero, and I think it was done marvelously.',\n",
       "   \"Sequels are very tricky. They're very hard to crack open, but every so often we do get a sequel that is better than the original like Empire Strikes Back, The Godfather Part II, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Aliens, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, The Dark Knight, and others. Spider-Man 2 is one of them. The common thing among mostly all sequels is that bigger is better, that's not always the case, and that's where director Sam Raimi comes in, he does the opposite. He makes it smaller, more personal, but with big impactful moments. Here we see a damaged Peter Parker, still full of guilt with the death of Uncle Ben, he's getting fired all the time and late to school because he's busy protecting New York as Spider-Man. His relationship between Harry and Mary Jane are deteriorating as he keeps disappointing them. In the end, he gives up his duties as Spider-Man, only to return to action when Doctor Octopus is threatening the city. This movie in many ways is a coming of age story for Peter Parker. With a moving romantic subplot, Peter learns to accept his responsibilities as Spider-Man in the long run, and puts that first above all his desires including Mary Jane, and he also finds closure by telling Aunt May the truth about what happened on the night of Uncle Ben's murder. Tobey Maguire brings much depth and complexity to Peter Parker. A very fine performance by him showcasing the right amount of emotion in every single scene. Alfred Molina is excellent here as Dr. Otto Octavius, also known as Doctor Octopus, whom Peter deems as his idol in the beginning of the film. What makes him such as awesome and likable villain, is that film allows you to like him from the beginning, and to see his downfall to villainy, then to a redeemable hero at the end makes an engaging story. Give credit to Raimi and his writing team, as they provide Doc Ock much needed flare. Kirsten Dunst here is pretty good as Mary Jane. Peter and Mary Jane also get a lot time bickering at each other here. It's a very complicated and complex romance as she wants Peter and Peter wants her, but he can't cause of his duties as a crime-fighter. James Franco is great playing the a-hole friend. As an audience member it's very sad to see their friendship deteriorate as Harry questions Peter's loyalty to him or to Spider-Man. The action serves the story here, it seamlessly transitions to action set pieces while still serving the narrative. Not to mention they are awesome. All the fights between Spidey and Doc Ock are an adrenaline rush, particularly the subway train fight. But with that being said, if you took out all the action sequences in this movie, you still have a very intriguing and moving story to watch. That's how good this film is. Raimi and his crew of filmmakers did a tremendous job with Spider-Man 2. There are real human moments in this film, one of them involves Spidey and a group of civilians in the train. A real nice, tender, and human scene. Rosemary Harris as Aunt May even has a substantial role in the film as Peter's moral compass and she also has an action sequence in the middle of the film. J.K. Simmons is even better as J. Jonah Jameson this time around and has the film's funniest moments. Everything in this film clicks on all cylinders. The music by Danny Elfman is better than ever, and also provides the film with lots of tender scores. The visual effects are better, Spidey's web-swinging abilities are better, the romance is better, the action is better, the sound mixing and editing is better, the story, the acting, just everything. It's pretty much a perfect film. I for one thought it deserved just a little bit more from the Academy Awards other than winning the well deserved special effects award. 10/10\",\n",
       "   'Being Spider-Man is wrecking poor Peter Parker\\'s life. He\\'s had to give up his chance at love with Mary Jane, he can\\'t hold a job because he\\'s always late, his grades are suffering at college, his Aunt May is struggling with the loss of beloved Uncle Ben, and his best friend Harry blames Spider-Man for the death of his father. All of this leads to Peter deciding to give up being a superhero. But a new threat rises in the form of mad physicist Otto Octavius, dubbed Dr. Octopus by the press, that may force Peter out of retirement.Sam Raimi\\'s direction is much improved from the first film. This one he seems completely at home with the big budget blockbuster and creates many memorable scenes and images, as he often does in his lower budget work. Comic fans should appreciate the homages to the works of Lee, Ditko, and Romita, The CGI improves from the first film. There\\'s still a little bit of the rubbery animated look of the CGI humans but not as distracting as before. The action is also more impressive. The fight scenes between Spider-Man and Dr. Octopus are well-done. The scene where Spidey saves an elevated train is arguably the movie\\'s highlight. Danny Elfman\\'s music is good but, as with the first film, not in the same league as his iconic Batman work.The cast knocks it out of the park. Tobey Maguire perfectly captures the essence of Peter Parker, even more so than the first movie. His inherent nerdiness, awkwardness, and struggle to do what\\'s right even at the cost of his own happiness. Kirsten Dunst and James Franco build upon their performances from the last movie. Dunst rises above the damsel-in-distress role she\\'s saddled with quite nicely and by the end finally feels like the iconic Mary Jane (\"Go get \\'em, Tiger.\"). Rosemary Harris gets far more to do as Aunt May this time around and she\\'s amazing. She steals every scene she\\'s in. The supporting cast (J.K. Simmons and the rest) are all great. Alfred Molina brings Dr. Octopus to life and treats the character seriously, which is miles above the hammy performance given by Willem Dafoe\\'s Green Goblin in the first film.When this came out, it was the best superhero movie since Superman \\'78. I walked out of the theater beaming from ear to ear and feeling like a kid again. It was one of the rare summer blockbusters I went to see more than once. It still holds up and is a high water-mark for Marvel movies, in my opinion. It\\'s followed by a terrible third film and then a reboot series that, while good, misses a lot of what makes this film work so well. This is the definitive Spider-Man movie. Lots of humor, heart, romance, and action all told in a bright, colorful fashion. Everything a Spider-Man film should be.',\n",
       "   \"I recently delved into a spree of superhero movies, but amidst the modern glitz, I felt it was time to revisit a true classic - Spider-Man 2. The movie presents a timeless story with solid tent poles and a strong focus on character development.Upon rewatching, I found myself enthralled once again, appreciating its ability to be repeatedly enjoyed. The visuals, though impressive in their time, might not stand up as strongly in the year 2023. Nonetheless, they still manage to convey the essence of the narrative effectively.While the antagonist could have been portrayed with greater strength, the character's development and writing were commendable, adding depth to the plot. However, it is the protagonist, Peter Parker, who steals the show with his compelling performance, leaving a lasting impression on the audience.In conclusion, Spider-Man 2 remains an awesome classic that stands the test of time. Despite minor visual limitations, the film's engaging story and well-crafted characters ensure you won't be bored, making it a worthy watch for both fans of the superhero genre and newcomers alike.\",\n",
       "   \"Sam Raimi greatly improves on his previous \\xadSPIDER-MAN flick, investing this one with twice the excitement, drama, and character tension. It feels like he was playing by the rules with the first movie â€“ following the studio's plans, never stepping out of line. Here we see the artist at work, delivering some great moments of cinema. There's even reference to Raimi's earlier horror career with buzzing chainsaws and severed limbs in the tense, quirky hospital showdown.The film retains the look, feel and sound of the first, and there's a strong sense of continuity with the return of literally ALL the characters (even Willem Dafoe makes a welcome cameo appearance as the Green Goblin). The love story, which felt a bit false in the first, is rampant here, with runaway emotion and non-stop romantic interludes, and also there is plenty of comedy to savour, dealing with Peter Parker's real-life chores being Spider-Man; i.e. his costume running in the wash and ruining the other clothes, etc. etc. It's very funny and is helped by loads of cool cameos â€“ Bruce Campbell is back and better than before as the 'Snooty Usher', Ted Raimi is present, and of course there's J. K. Simmons, whose overbearing newspaper editor nearly steals the film.Maguire and Dunst seem more assured and in touch with their characters here, and Alfred Molina is an imposing but surprisingly human baddie. Every major character is fleshed out and concentrated on, no cardboard cut-outs or stereotypes to be seen. There are many twists and surprises before the end and although this is a lengthy film, it never outstays its welcome. The best parts are undoubtedly the action sequences, which take CGI effects to new heights (literally).The shots of Spider-Man swinging through the air are, as many have said, much more convincing and realistic than before, and the various battles with Doc Ock are outrageously exciting and crowd-pleasing. My favourite moment is undoubtedly the clash on the speeding train at the end of the movie, which is flawless cinema, original and artistic, perfectly conceived, and the winning element at this film's heart is Raimi's confidence at the helm this time. Things never become boring and this seems to be a film you can watch over and over. I'm left eagerly awaiting the third in the series.\",\n",
       "   \"It's hard to decide whether or not I prefer this film to the first, as it tells - in some ways - a more mature, nuanced and layered tale, but what isn't hard to decide is that 'Spider-Man 2 (2004)' is a fantastic movie and easily one of the best sequels of all time. The villain is wonderfully rounded, his motivations constantly clear and his character arc drawn in full before the credits roll, and presents both a physical and psychological challenge for our hero. The story expertly balances the phenomenally fun yet still emotionally resonant web-slinging sequences (a high-speed train in danger provides one of the feature's nicest character moments whereas the whole 'bank' section is amazingly accomplished and thunderously entertaining) with the relatable central dilemma of our very human protagonist. Raimi's directing seems to be stepped up a little, too, as he leans further into his own quirky style - evident in the renowned 'surgery' scene which is one of the best in the entire film. The entire piece just gels together to make a cohesive, complex and rare example of the superhero genre at some of its very best. 9/10\",\n",
       "   'Wow. That\\'s all I can manage to say after watching this film, wow. This movie really blew me away in all its aspects. The performances were top rate, especially Alfred Molina\\'s portrayal of Dr. Otto Octavius. He really knows how to play that comic book villain with a sense of understanding so to speak. Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst romance is a truly interesting and different outlook on being a super hero. We often dream of being super heroes, and yet here we see just the opposite. The audience feels Peter\\'s conflict between protecting the innocent and letting his own life suffer or letting it go and living the life he\\'s always wanted. To get everything he ever desired, he must give up his double-life. Despite whether he gives up being Spider-man or not, he will still forever have to deal with the complication of his dying friendship with Harry Osborn( James Franco). Franco is my favorite actor in this film, a young millionaire dealing with the death of his father, his friend being the only one who can help him bring the murder to justice. And yet, unbeknownst to him, his friend is actually the wall crawler himself. A extremely well done screenplay. Sam Raimi adds touches of humor to the story and it blends in quite well.The characters are just so well done and intertwined with one another. Sam Raimi makes more than just a comic blockbuster but a well-defined drama of sorts. Even the villain has his moments.The action is unbelievable and truly out does the first. Future superhero films will have to work hard to surpass what is seen here. The train chase is by far my favorite scene in the film, truly adrenaline pumping!! Audiences do have to wait a bit, but once a fight starts prepare to be simply amazed. Not only this, but the score is magnificent!! I love Danny Elfman!! It captures each moment exactly the way audiences envision it. Another sequel is surely on the way. This is definitely one of my favorite films of 2004, putting other comic book films of the same year to shame, such as \"Blade: Trinity\".'],\n",
